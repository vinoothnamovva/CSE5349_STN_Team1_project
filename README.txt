1.Load all the ipynb files into the jupiter notebook and download the  data set from the folder.
2.Load the maskdetect_training.ipynb into the jupiter notebook and load the downloaded data set using below commands in the maskdetect_training.ipynb 
  in the second cell.
	Dataset=r'C:\Users\siris\OneDrive\Desktop\dataset'
3.Run the maskdetect_training.ipynb by clicking on Kernel->Run All
4.Here after running the maskdetect_training.ipynb, we get the training set accuracy of 97%

maskdetect using image:

5.Now, Run the maskdetect_images.ipynb to test whether the model is working for images.
6.Load the image example_01 into the folder and run the maskdetect_images.ipynb and we get the output for the image as mask:100%

Maskdetect using video

7.Now, Run the maskdetect_video.ipynb to test whether the model is working for video. Make sure the webcam in the laptop is working.
8. run the maskdetect_video.ipynb and we get the output for the video as mask or no mask.
